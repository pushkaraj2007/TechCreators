## 👩🏽‍💻 Demo

Check out the website: [TechCreators](https://techcreators.vercel.app)

## 👇🏽 Prerequisites

Before installation, please make sure you have already installed the following tools:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## 🛠️ Installation Steps

- [Fork](https://github.com/pushkaraj2007/TechCreators/fork) the project. Click on the <a href="https://github.com/pushkaraj2007/TechCreators/fork"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/G4z1kEe.png" height="15" width="15"></a> icon in the top right to get started.

- Use these commands in your git bash to make a clone of the project in your pc.

### SSH [Github Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh)

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:username/TechCreators
```

### GitHub CLI

```bash
$ gh repo clone username/TechCreators
```

### HTTPS

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/username/TechCreators
```

- Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd TechCreators
```

## 🔥 Add your profile

1. Fork the project:

- Click the gray `Fork` button in the top right of this page. This creates _your_ copy of the project and saves it as a new repository in your github account

2. Create a New Branch:

- On your new repository's page, click the gray `main` button in the upper left to reveal a dropdown menu.
- Enter the name of your new branch in the text box. (Branch names usually make a reference to what is being changed. Example: `profileAdd`).
- Click on `Create branch <new branch name>` and this will automatically take you to your new branch. You can make edits on the main branch, but this may cause issues down the line. Best practice is to create a new branch for each separate issue you work on. That way your `main` branch remains in sync with TechCreators `main` branch.

3. Navigate to file:

- Navigate to the profile/profile.json file.

4. Edit:

- On the top right of the JSON file, click on the pencil icon to edit the file by adding your image, name and username.
- You can add JSON object wherever you want in the file, it will automatically arrange according to alphabetical order.
- After editing the JSON file, add a commit message and click on the green button saying "Commit Changes". Make sure you have selected the branch you have created.

5. Raise a Pull Request:

- And finally create a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)!
- Great job! You did it!
